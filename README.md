# Face-Recognition
Face Recognition is the way of identifying or confirming an individul's identity using their face. One of the common use of face recogniation is unlocking phone. Other uses are Airport and border control, Finding missing person, Improving retail, Banking, Marketing, Healthcare, Tracking, Gaming, Military and so on. We have decided to break the project into 5 phases such as Face detection and OpenCV, Develop face recognition model, Facial emotion recognination, Integrete face recogniation and deployment for web.
